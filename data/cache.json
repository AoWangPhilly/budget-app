Sugar mix will slowly turn into a syrup. Syrup will eventually reduce and turn its color to golden brown.You may want to turn the apples upside down 1 or 2 times very carefully, using two forks. I decided to do so just because I wanted to be sure that syrup coats the apples all over.The approximate time of the apple cooking for me was around 25-30 minutes, but you should let your eyes determine the final cooking time, rather than my approximation.When you think the syrup and apples are ready, very carefully, trying to avoid the nasty burns from the syrup, pop the puff dough circle on top of the apples. Using a wooden spoon gently tuck the dough around the apples, so that it hugs them just slightly. Its best if the dough actually touches the walls of the pan.","ingredients":[{"id":9152,"name":"lemon juice","localizedName":"lemon juice","image":"lemon-juice.jpg"},{"id":1052050,"name":"vanilla","localizedName":"vanilla","image":"vanilla.jpg"},{"id":9003,"name":"apple","localizedName":"apple","image":"apple.jpg"},{"id":1001,"name":"butter","localizedName":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"spread","localizedName":"spread","image":""},{"id":0,"name":"dough","localizedName":"dough","image":"pizza-dough"},{"id":0,"name":"sauce","localizedName":"sauce","image":""},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","localizedName":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":0,"name":"syrup","localizedName":"syrup","image":""},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"pop","localizedName":"soft drink","image":""}],"equipment":[{"id":404732,"name":"wooden spoon","localizedName":"wooden spoon","image":"wooden-spoon.jpg"},{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","localizedName":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}],"length":{"number":30,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Place the pan in the oven and bake for about 30 minutes, until dough is nicely browned","ingredients":[{"id":0,"name":"dough","localizedName":"dough","image":"pizza-dough"}],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}],"length":{"number":30,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":5,"step":"Remove the pan from the oven and let it rest for about 5 minutes.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":6,"step":"Place a serving plate on top of the pan, bottom up, and holding the plate tightly pressed against the pan, carefully flip the contents onto the plate.Rearrange the apples gently if they shifted too much and let the syrup trickle down into the puff crust.","ingredients":[{"id":9003,"name":"apple","localizedName":"apple","image":"apple.jpg"},{"id":0,"name":"crust","localizedName":"crust","image":""},{"id":0,"name":"syrup","localizedName":"syrup","image":""}],"equipment":[{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":7,"step":"Serve warm.
